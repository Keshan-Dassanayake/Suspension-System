<h1>Suspension System</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project involves the basic design of a suspension system, focusing on one wheel and its essential components. Created using SolidWorks, the model includes parts such as the control arm, spring, and wheel hub. While not a complete suspension system, it serves as a foundation for understanding suspension mechanics and can be further expanded for comprehensive vehicle applications.
